Lab Assignment (Report)
1. Write a program to implement a simple calculator with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program should handle invalid input and exceptions, such as dividing by zero or entering non-numeric characters.
2. Write a program to store and calculate grades for students. The program should read marks from the user, calculate the grade, and handle invalid inputs.
3. Design a program to simulate a bank account. The system should allow the user to deposit and withdraw money while handling exceptions.
4. Write a Java program to read content from a file and write content to a new file. Handle IOException and ensure proper resource management.
5. Simulate an ATM withdrawal system where users can check their balance, deposit money, or withdraw money. Ensure that sufficient balance is available before allowing a withdrawal.
6. Suppose you are launching an old age home. For your home you are developing a software who can decide that the parents are allowed to your home or not. Now write a java program which can solve this problem.
7. Write a program to calculate an employee's salary after deductions based on certain conditions. Handle exceptions such as invalid salary input or deduction exceeding salary.
8. Simulate a multi-threaded bank system where multiple threads can access and update a bank account balance. Use proper synchronization to avoid concurrency issues.
9. Develop a simple shopping cart system for an online store where users can add products to the cart, view the cart, and check out.
10. Create a program that takes a user input (age, salary, etc.) and applies appropriate validation. Throw custom exceptions with meaningful messages when validation fails.
11. Write a program for enrolling students in a course. Ensure that each course has a fixed number of seats, and handle exceptions if a student tries to enroll in a full course.
12. Write a java program that is an example of synchronised multithreading.
13. Write a java program that is an example of unsynchronised multithreading.
